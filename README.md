# Chrome_Data_Collection
# Java program that opens Chrome, goes to a website, makes a search and collects the data into a CSV file. 

# For this project I am using Eclipse JDK, but it shouldn't matter what software you use. 

# First you will need to go and see what Version your chrome is and download the driver for it. [which you can find here: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj52JPQ46P7AhVfmGoFHeevBrIQFnoECBIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchromedriver.chromium.org%2Fdownloads&usg=AOvVaw2Eziwaoh6-1UgCajyO_O8n]

# Then download and install all the Selenium Jars, in Eclipse you add External Archive and select all the .jar files. 

# After that all you should have to do is change the file paths to where your files are and the program should work. 

# The Java files are in the Code folder
